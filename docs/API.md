# API Reference

Status: Draft stub (to unblock CI link checks)

This page will define the integration contract for VoxCompose within the VoiceCore ecosystem.

Planned sections:
- Integration modes (CLI, plugin, service)
- Input/Output schemas and examples
- Versioning and compatibility
- Error handling and diagnostics
- Performance SLAs and tuning parameters

If youâ€™re reading this in a release prior to the first stable docs, this is a placeholder to keep links stable while the documentation is authored.

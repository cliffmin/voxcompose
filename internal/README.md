Internal Documentation (Private)

This directory is intended for internal, non-public documentation such as:
- Runbooks and operational procedures
- Incident response and on-call playbooks
- Credentials handling and deployment specifics (never commit secrets)
- Cost/ops notes and service topology details

Guidelines
- Treat contents as confidential. Do not publish or share externally.
- Avoid storing secrets in plain text; reference vault/secret managers instead.
- When possible, prefer a private repository or company wiki for sensitive materials.

Currently, no files have been moved here because the repository contains only public-facing documentation. Add internal docs here as needed.
